# Password Policy Review

## Objective
Review and improve password policies to reduce the risk of
unauthorized access and credential compromise.

---

## Current Risks
- Weak or short passwords
- Password reuse across systems
- Lack of account lockout policies

## Recommended Policy
- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Complexity: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Password expiration every 90 days
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where possible

## Implementation Areas
- Active Directory Group Policies
- Cloud services (Microsoft 365)
- VPN and remote access systems

---

## Security Benefit
Strong password policies reduce the risk of brute-force attacks,
credential stuffing, and unauthorized access.
